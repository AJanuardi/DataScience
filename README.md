Traffic Accident Analysis
The goal of this project is the investigate what causes not serious and serious accidents in hopes of preventing and decreasing the number of them. The dataset consists of accident records from the UK over the course of 15+ years. I hope to show the causes of these accidents through visualizations and create an algorithm that can predict the severity of accidents.

The UK government collects and publishes (usually on an annual basis) detailed information about traffic accidents across the country. This information includes, but is not limited to, geographical locations, weather conditions, type of vehicles, number of casualties and vehicle manoeuvres, making this a very interesting and comprehensive dataset for analysis and research.
